# Minimalist Website

A modern, high-fidelity landing page for a fictional digital banking platform.  
The project demonstrates production-level frontend development â€” not just styling, but building an experience that feels like a live product pitch.

## Highlights

- **Fully interactive interface**: modal windows, tabbed feature sections, testimonials slider, and smooth scrolling navigation.
- **Performance-minded design**: lazy-loaded images, efficient DOM updates, and CSS optimizations for fast rendering.
- **Responsive across all breakpoints**: carefully tailored layouts for mobile, tablet, and desktop with a mobile-first approach.
- **Clean architecture**: modular JavaScript, semantic HTML, and scalable CSS that can grow with the product.
- **Attention to detail**: sticky navigation, hover/focus effects, animated section reveals, and a polished mobile hamburger menu.

In this project every piece was built to mimic how a real product team would ship a marketing site.

## Why this project

Bankist was built to reflect how I approach frontend work:

- Write code that **others can read and extend**.
- Treat performance and responsiveness as **first-class features**.
- Deliver a product that looks **ready for users**.
